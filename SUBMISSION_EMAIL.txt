Subject: Constructure AI - Technical Assignment Submission

Hi,

I have completed the Applied LLM Engineer technical assignment. The project is a RAG-powered construction document Q&A application with source citations and structured data extraction.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/ishika2236/ConstructionChatbot
Frontend (Vercel): [Add your Vercel frontend URL]
Backend: Running locally with ngrok tunnel (see note below)

The repository includes complete setup instructions, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive documentation in ASSIGNMENT_SUBMISSION.md.

Note on Deployment: Due to memory constraints on free hosting tiers (512MB limit vs ~400MB required), the backend is demonstrated via local deployment with ngrok public tunnel. The frontend is fully deployed on Vercel. For production, this would be hosted on Railway/Render paid tier or Azure App Service.

Login credentials for testing: testingcheckuser1234@gmail.com

Key Features:
- RAG-powered Q&A with Azure OpenAI GPT-4o
- Structured data extraction (door schedules, room summaries)
- Vector search with optimized embeddings
- Modern Next.js frontend with responsive design
- Comprehensive evaluation framework
